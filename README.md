# Monster Stats Plugin

## Description

The Monster Stats Plugin provides a quick way to access the defensive stats of NPCs in Old School RuneScape (OSRS).

Shoutout to 'Coinmagnet_rs' on reddit for the original idea/request.

## Features

- **Hover Tooltip**: Toggle-able tooltip that displays elemental weaknesses and percentages as well as defensive stats for all styles. Compatible with other tooltips (like Runelite's Mouse Tooltips Plugin)
