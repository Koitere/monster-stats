## Disclaimer

Please note that this plugin is still in development. Some features may not work as expected, and there may be occasional bugs or performance issues. We appreciate your feedback and patience as we continue to improve the plugin.

NPCs that have multiple 'forms' (e.g. Guards) and as a result have switch infoboxes on the Wiki may not display the correct stats, I'm still working out a way around this but at the moment a good majority of NPCs work properly.
